# Learning Out Loud with Akiem

Welcome to my journey from zero to full-stack developer! This site is my personal blog and progress tracker as I work through the freeCodeCamp curriculum and build my capstone project over the next six months. Here, you'll find my learning goals, milestones, and updates on what I'm building and learning.

## 🚀 About This Project

**Learning Out Loud with Akiem** is a documentation of my path to becoming a full-stack web developer. I’m sharing my progress, learning resources, and reflections as I complete four freeCodeCamp certifications and build a capstone project, all starting from June 1, 2025.

The site is built with:
- **HTML5 & CSS3**  
- **Bootstrap 5** for responsive design  
- **JavaScript** for interactivity (coming soon)
